#Udacity Profolio Mockup
This was the first project in the Udacity Nano Degree. You can find the course [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud304). The page was written using HTML, CSS, and a little JQuery. It was also an introduction to Bootstrap for me, specifically using grids. We were given a simple PSD and tasked with creating a responsive portfolio based on the mockup using Bootstrap. I created modals for each project. Note that these projects were mainly ideas for future projects in mind.

####Final Thoughts
It was a great experience for me. I feel fairly confident using Bootstrap and creating responsive sites. Find the link to my project [here](http://dqc.github.io/nanodegree-project1/).
